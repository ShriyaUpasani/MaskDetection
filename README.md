# MaskDetection

I developed an AI model to accurately detect individuals not wearing masks using live camera feeds. This model leverages transfer learning with the VGG-19 architecture, a deep learning concept-based model.

The robust mask detection model I built combines transfer learning (VGG-19) and the HaarCascade classifier. The HaarCascade classifier is employed to detect faces and generate bounding boxes around them. These face images are then fed into the VGG-19 model to classify them into "mask" and "no mask" labels. This approach successfully achieved an accuracy of 98%.
